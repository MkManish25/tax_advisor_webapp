You can invest up to \u20b91.5 lakhs in options like ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme), PPF (Public Provident Fund), EPF (Employee Provident Fund), life insurance premiums, or children's tuition fees to save significant tax.\n- Claim HRA Exemption: You receive a substantial HRA but have reported \u20b90 rent paid. If you are paying rent, ensure you claim HRA exemption. This can drastically reduce your taxable income. If you are not paying rent, consider starting to do so, if feasible, to avail this benefit.\n- Invest in NPS for additional deduction: Beyond 80C, you can invest an additional \u20b950,000 in the National Pension System (NPS) under Section 80CCD(1B), which is a powerful way to reduce your taxable income further.\n- Opt for Health Insurance Premiums (80D): You can claim deductions for health insurance premiums paid for yourself, your family (spouse and children), and your parents. This can provide a deduction of up to \u20b925,000 (and an additional \u20b925,000/\u20b950,000 for parents).\n- Evaluate Old vs. New Tax Regime: With your high income and the potential to utilize various deductions (80C, HRA, 80D, NPS), sticking to the Old Tax Regime (where these deductions are allowed) might be more beneficial than opting for the New Tax Regime (which offers lower slab rates but fewer deductions). Calculate both scenarios carefully."}

If you are currently paying rent, ensure you collect valid rent receipts. If not, consider structuring your living situation to pay rent to a landlord to avail this substantial exemption.\n- Invest in Health Insurance (Section 80D): Secure your health and finances by investing in a health insurance policy. You can claim a deduction of up to \u20b925,000 for premiums paid for yourself, your spouse, and dependent children. An additional deduction of up to \u20b925,000 (or \u20b950,000 for senior citizens) is available for parents' health insurance premiums.\n- Contribute to National Pension System (NPS) under Section 80CCD(1B): Beyond the \u20b91,50,000 limit of Section 80C, you can claim an additional deduction of up to \u20b950,000 by contributing to the NPS, a long-term retirement savings product."}
